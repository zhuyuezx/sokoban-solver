## 🚀 Quick Start

### Online (Recommended)
Simply visit the [live application](https://dangarfield.github.io/sokoban-solver/) - no installation required!

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dangarfield/sokoban-solver.git
cd sokoban-solver

# Serve locally (any web server works)
npx serve .
# or
python -m http.server 8000
# or
php -S localhost:8000

# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## 🎮 How to Play

### Basic Controls
- **Movement**: `WASD` keys or arrow keys
- **Reset Level**: `Escape` or `Space`
- **Voice Commands**: Say "up", "down", "left", "right", or "restart"

### Level Editor
1. **Click any cell** to cycle through types:
   - Floor (empty space)
   - Wall (obstacle)
   - Block (pushable box)
   - Target (goal position)
   - Player (starting position)
   - Target & Block together
   - Target & Player together

2. **Save your level** using the save button
3. **Share your creation** with the export button

### Using the Solver
1. **Click "Solve"** to start the AI solver
2. **Watch progress** as it explores possible moves
3. **Navigate solution** with Previous/Next buttons
4. **Solutions are cached** for instant replay

## 🧠 Solver Algorithm

The application uses **Festival**, a high-performance Sokoban solver that combines optimal search strategies with advanced pruning techniques.

### Festival Algorithm Overview
Festival is a state-of-the-art solver originally developed in C++ by Yaron Shoham. This implementation is a Rust port compiled to WebAssembly for browser execution.

**Key Features:**
- **Pattern Database Heuristics** - Pre-computed lookup tables for accurate distance estimates
- **Advanced Deadlock Detection** - Identifies unsolvable positions early (freeze deadlock, bipartite matching)
- **Macro Moves** - Optimizes sequences of moves into single operations
- **Transposition Tables** - Avoids re-exploring identical board states
- **Lower Bound Pruning** - Eliminates branches that cannot lead to optimal solutions

### Performance Optimizations
- **Rust + WebAssembly** - Near-native performance in the browser (10-100x faster than JavaScript)
- **Non-blocking UI** - Solver runs in a Web Worker without freezing the interface
- **Real-time Progress** - Live updates on explored states and search progress
- **Memory Efficient** - Optimized state representation and hash tables
- **Optimal Solutions** - Finds shortest push solutions for most puzzles

## 🎨 Level Format

Levels use the standard XSB (Extended Sokoban) text format:
```
Level: My Custom Level
########
#  .   #
# $  @ #
#      #
########
```

**Symbols (XSB Standard):**
- `#` = Wall
- ` ` = Floor (empty space)
- `$` = Box (crate to push)
- `.` = Goal (target position)
- `@` = Player starting position
- `*` = Box on goal
- `+` = Player on goal

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adding Levels
Edit `grids/Base-Levels.txt` to include new puzzles using XSB format:
```
Level: Easy Puzzle
####
#.@#
#$ #
####

Level: Medium Challenge
#######
#.  @ #
# $$  #
#  .  #
#######
```
